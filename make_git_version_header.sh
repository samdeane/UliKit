#   Run this file as part of your build process to extract the latest
#   revision from your Git working copy and create a 'svn_version.h'
#   file defining a SVN_VERSION constant to that value.
#
#	This is for a user-visible build number, so we use the number of revisions
#	and not the actual git hash.
#
#   The file will be created in the current directory and the subversion
#   revision number is extracted from the current folder's .svn/entries
#   file.
